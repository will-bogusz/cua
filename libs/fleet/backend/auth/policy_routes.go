// The policy trees production routes are built from.
//
// They live here rather than in main.go so that exactly one definition exists:
// main.go's route constructors call these, and policy_golden_test.go's snapshot
// table names these same functions. A tree defined in main.go and copied into
// the test would let production authorization be reordered with the golden
// still green — the copy, not the route, is what such a snapshot pins.
//
// Registered() resolves through the module registry that LoadOpa populates, so
// these constructors stay pure data: no I/O, no compilation, safe to call
// before LoadOpa. A name that was never registered surfaces at Compile time,
// which for a route means PolicyMiddleware panicking during construction.

// Every route policy is All(BasePolicy(), <its surface>). That is not a
// convention imposed on the Rego — it is the Rego's own structure, made visible.
// All 30 route-gated allow rules of the former monolith shared exactly one
// condition, a non-empty subject, and each was gated to a route belonging to one
// surface. So for a request on route R,
//
//	All(base, surface_R)  ≡  the old authz.allow
//
// with base the shared condition and surface_R the disjunction of R's rules
// minus it. Rules of another surface could not have fired on R in the first
// place, because their route gates would not match; the surfaces' route sets are
// pairwise disjoint, the only prefix rule (billing) overlapping no other
// surface's literals. auth/testdata/route-authorization-table.txt is the
// executable form of that argument: it was recorded against the monolith, and
// the split had to leave every cell of it unmoved.

// BasePolicy is the check every authenticated route runs whatever its surface:
// a non-empty subject. Denies are a 403 and an undecidable evaluation is a 500,

// the principal's family has already answered:
//
//   - Any stops at the first true, so a GitHub or per-key principal whose claim
//     matches never reaches the second child at all.
//   - All stops at the first false, so a principal a K8s probe cannot speak for
//     — a GitHub token, a per-key service account — denies before the loader.

// That laziness is what sinkFactLoaders exists to guarantee: the declaration
