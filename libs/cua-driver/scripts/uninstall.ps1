# cua-driver-rs uninstaller (Windows) — removes the runtime installed by install.ps1
# laid down: the Scheduled Task autostart entry, running daemon
# processes, the directory junctions wiring the visible bin dir back to
# a per-version release dir, the entire package home tree, and any skill
# junctions the binary's `skills install` verb dropped under the agent
# config directories.
#
# Usage (one-liner — recommended):
#   irm https://cua.ai/driver/uninstall.ps1 | iex
#
# Force (skip all prompts):
#   $env:CUA_DRIVER_RS_UNINSTALL_FORCE = '1'
#   irm https://cua.ai/driver/uninstall.ps1 | iex
#
# Why an env var and not a `-Force` parameter: `iex` (Invoke-Expression)
# refuses to parse a script that opens with `[CmdletBinding()] param(...)`
# — the natural one-liner above otherwise fails with
# "Unexpected attribute 'CmdletBinding'" at parse time. Reading the flag
# from $env: keeps the body iex-safe, and the env var inherits across
# the self-elevation re-exec for free (no -ArgumentList forwarding).
#
# What gets removed:
#   - Scheduled Task 'cua-driver-serve' (autostart entry registered by
#     `cua-driver autostart enable` or install.ps1 -AutoStart)
#   - Any running cua-driver.exe processes (so file handles don't pin
#     the binary directory open during the delete pass)
#   - <visibleBinDir>     = %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Cua\cua-driver\bin  (directory junction)
#   - <currentDir>        = %USERPROFILE%\.cua-driver\packages\current  (directory junction)
#   - <packageHome>\packages and runtime artifacts. The pseudonymous telemetry
#     id, preference, and registration markers are preserved unless purge is
#     explicitly requested.
#   - Skill junctions under:
#       %USERPROFILE%\.claude\skills\cua-driver-rs
#       %USERPROFILE%\.agents\skills\cua-driver-rs
#       %USERPROFILE%\.openclaw\skills\cua-driver-rs
#       %APPDATA%\opencode\skills\cua-driver-rs
#     (each only when it's a reparse point — never clobber a real dir).
#
# Conservative on Claude MCP cleanup: we DON'T auto-edit %USERPROFILE%\
# .claude.json on Windows (mirrors the macOS uninstall.sh's stance for
# environments without python3). The closing message prints the
# `claude mcp remove cua-driver-rs` command for the user to run.
#
# Env overrides (mirror install.ps1's variable names):
#   $env:CUA_DRIVER_RS_INSTALL_DIR   visible bin dir to remove
#                                    (default %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Cua\cua-driver\bin;
#                                     v0.2.13 and earlier used Programs\trycua\cua-driver-rs\bin
#                                     — that legacy path is always cleaned up too)
#   $env:CUA_DRIVER_RS_HOME          package home to remove
#                                    (default %USERPROFILE%\.cua-driver;

#                                     that legacy path is always cleaned up too)
#
# Env (force mode):
#   $env:CUA_DRIVER_RS_UNINSTALL_FORCE
#               non-interactive: skip the "remove? [y/N]" prompt before
#               each major delete. The one-liner is interactive by
#               default so a stray paste doesn't accidentally wipe a
#               working install. Inherited automatically by the elevated
#               re-exec child (see Elevation below).
#
# Env (purge identity, preference, and encrypted Computer History):
#   $env:CUA_DRIVER_RS_UNINSTALL_PURGE = '1'
#               also delete the package home after removing the runtime.
#
# Elevation:
#   `install.ps1 -AutoStart` (and `cua-driver autostart enable`) register
#   the `cua-driver-serve` Scheduled Task at RunLevel=Highest — the
#   daemon spawned by it then runs at High IL so it can drive UWP /
#   AppContainer apps (Calculator, Settings, Photos — see
#   autostart.rs:127). Side-effect: a non-elevated process (even the same
#   user that installed it) can NOT terminate the daemon or delete the
#   task — both fail with Access Denied, and the binary stays locked
#   under ~\.cua-driver\... . If we detect either condition at startup
#   we self-elevate via UAC; otherwise we run in-place. Mirrors the
#   install side's elevation pattern in autostart.rs:215-223.
