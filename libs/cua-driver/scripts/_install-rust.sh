# _install-rust.sh — private helper invoked by libs/cua-driver/scripts/install.sh
# (the canonical user-facing installer) for the default Rust implementation.
# Not intended for direct
# invocation; user-facing one-liners always go through the parent
# install.sh, which forwards args + sets up the lockfile.
#
# Downloads the latest cua-driver-rs release tarball from GitHub Releases
# and drops the binary into ~/.local/bin (or a path given via --bin-dir /
# CUA_DRIVER_RS_INSTALL_DIR). Sudo-free.
#
# This is the cross-platform cua-driver implementation for macOS / Linux /
# Windows via WSL or git-bash. The retired Swift implementation (macOS
# only) still ships separately under tag prefix `cua-driver-v*`; this
# helper is hard-pinned to `cua-driver-rs-v*` and will never pick it up.
#
# Canonical user-facing invocation (forwards here by default):
#   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://cua.ai/driver/install.sh)"
#
# Flags:
#   --bin-dir <path>     install the visible binary/symlink to <path>
#                        instead of ~/.local/bin
#   --no-modify-path     skip auto-appending an `export PATH=...` line
#   --channel <name>     persist and install the latest stable or nightly release
#
# Env overrides:
#   CUA_DRIVER_RS_VERSION=0.1.2          pin a stable release

#   CUA_DRIVER_RS_BIN_DIR=PATH           legacy alias for INSTALL_DIR
#   CUA_DRIVER_RS_HOME=PATH              package home for versioned installs
#                                        (default ~/.cua-driver). Holds

#                                        Renamed from ~/.cua-driver-rs in
#                                        v0.2.16 / PR #1644 — this release
#                                        installer was missed in that rename
#                                        and is reconciled here; a stale
#                                        ~/.cua-driver-rs is swept post-install.
#   CUA_DRIVER_RS_NO_MODIFY_PATH=1       same as --no-modify-path

#                                        release dirs after install; older
#                                        ones are deleted (default 5; set 0
#                                        to disable GC entirely). Per-target
#                                        — multi-arch dirs are pruned
#                                        independently of each other.

# On-disk layout (Linux; macOS keeps its .app-in-/Applications layout, see

#     packages/
#       releases/
#         0.1.3-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/cua-driver   (per-version binary)
#         0.1.4-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/cua-driver
#       current/cua-driver -> ../releases/<active>/cua-driver  (active version)
#   $CUA_DRIVER_RS_INSTALL_DIR/cua-driver -> $HOME/packages/current/cua-driver
#
# Atomic upgrade: a new install drops the binary into a fresh per-version
# dir, then rename(2)-swaps the `current` symlink to point at it. A
# running daemon keeps its already-mmap'd binary open across the swap
# (open file handles survive). Rollback: re-point `current` at any older
# entry under `releases/`.
#
# Post-install GC trims the per-target release dirs so disk usage stays
# bounded (each release dir is ~15 MB, so an indefinite series of
# upgrades grows without bound). The N most-recent dirs are kept (default
# 5, override via CUA_DRIVER_RS_KEEP_VERSIONS); the dir that `current`
# resolves to is always preserved even if its mtime would otherwise drop
# it off the list. GC runs after the atomic swap so the about-to-be-active
# version is never a deletion candidate.

# --- Concurrent-install lockfile ---------------------------------------
#
# A second install kicked off while a first is still running can race
# on the atomic `current` symlink swap and produce a half-installed
# state (e.g. the symlink points at a dir whose binary the first install
# hasn't finished copying). Serialize installs per $HOME_DIR with a
# process-level mutex.
#
# Primitive: mkdir on POSIX is atomic. The first install to create
# $LOCK_DIR holds the lock; concurrent attempts get EEXIST and poll.
# Released via trap on every exit path (success, error, signal) so
# a half-finished install always frees the lock for the next one.
#
# Stale-lock recovery: if the holder dies without releasing (kill -9,
# OOM, host reboot mid-install), the lock dir sits around forever and
# every subsequent install hangs. After $LOCK_STALE_AFTER_SECONDS of
# waiting we probe the holder's liveness via `kill -0 <pid>` (the pid
# is stamped into $LOCK_INFO right after acquisition) — if the holder
# is alive we keep waiting (slow download / wedged network is not the
# same as a crashed install and we must not yank the lock out from
# under a live process), if it's dead we force-release with a loud log
# and proceed. The alternative (hang forever) leaves users in a
# permanently wedged state with no clear recovery path beyond `rm -rf`
# on an internal-looking dir.

# --- Clean up a pre-existing LOCAL (install-local) install --------------
#
# `install-local.sh` (`_install-local-rust.sh`) installs a dev build into the
# SAME canonical home this release installer now writes to (~/.cua-driver, see
# the HOME_DIR reconciliation above), under a `*-local-*` versioned release dir
# (VERSION_TAG="0.0.0-local-<config>"). On macOS it also cert-signs the shared
# /Applications/CuaDriver.app with a self-signed identity recorded at
# `~/.cua-driver/.tcc-signing-identity`.
#
# A user who ran install-local and then runs this release installer would
# otherwise end up with the local artifacts lingering alongside the fresh
# release: the `*-local-*` release dir(s) sit in `packages/releases/` (the
# release `current` swap re-points away from them, but they're never removed
# explicitly here), and the stale `.tcc-signing-identity` marker survives even
# though the release bundle is CI-signed, not locally cert-signed. Follow the
# same logic install-local / uninstall.sh use: stop the daemon, then remove
# ONLY the unambiguously-local artifacts so the release install is the single
# authoritative one.
#
# Conservative by construction: we only ever remove `*-local-*` release dirs
# and the local signing-identity marker — never a real release dir, never the
# `current` symlink (the release branch owns that), never unrelated user state
# under the home. Every step is best-effort + idempotent; a machine with no
# prior local install is a clean no-op.

# requirements. Compatible releases preserve grants; a proven mismatch resets
# only the stale Cua Driver rows after the replacement is registered.

# slower, and an unnecessary translation when a native arm64 binary
# exists on the release page.

#      unauthenticated = 60 req/hr per IP)
#
# The baked value is the common-case default: `curl ... | bash` against
# `main` resolves the version locally with zero API calls, so an API
# outage / rate limit / network blip can't break a default install. The
# API is consulted only when the baked line is absent (dev / pre-release
# checkouts) or when the baked version turns out to have no downloadable
# asset — see the recovery at the download step below.

# ~~~ END_BAKED_VERSION ~~~

# Run API requests with an optional token. Keep the header construction here
# (rather than in loggable command text) so neither GH_TOKEN nor GITHUB_TOKEN

# the repository is public and curl may redirect them to another GitHub host.

# macOS: install the .app to /Applications first, then symlink the
# bin into the bundle so `~/.local/bin/cua-driver` resolves into
# `/Applications/CuaDriver.app/Contents/MacOS/cua-driver`. The
# `realpath` walk in `is_executable_inside_cuadriver_app()` keys on
# that resolved path to know whether the auto-relaunch heuristic
# should fire. Same path and same bundle id as the Swift `cua-driver`
# install (`/Applications/CuaDriver.app`, `com.trycua.driver`). The installer
# also proves whether the replacement satisfies the previous app's designated
# requirement; the bundle identifier alone is not enough to preserve TCC.
#
# The macOS path intentionally does NOT use the
# $HOME_DIR/packages/releases/<v>/ + current symlink layout used on
# Linux. Reason: /Applications/CuaDriver.app placement is the
# anchor for both TCC attribution (cdhash + bundle id) and
# LaunchServices' `open -a CuaDriver` discovery — symlinking the
# .app from /Applications to a versioned dir under $HOME_DIR breaks
# both. The asymmetry is deliberate; rollback on macOS = reinstall
# an older release tag.
#
# Linux: drop the binary into the per-version dir under
# $HOME_DIR/packages/releases/<version>-<target>/ and swap the
# `current` symlink atomically. The visible $BIN_DIR/cua-driver
# symlinks into `current` so PATH consumers (and MCP client configs)
# never need to change when the active version moves.
