# CUA Driver Test Matrix

This is the source map for the Rust test suites in `libs/cua-driver`. It uses
two top-level test classes:

1. **Unit and deterministic protocol tests.** These do not depend on a repo-local
   application or an interactive desktop.
2. **Harness E2E tests.** These build and launch a repo-local application, drive
   it through the Rust driver, and verify an external application or desktop
   oracle.

A test is E2E because it crosses the driver, OS, window system, and application
boundary. The Rust harness catalog and its external oracles are the source of
truth.

## Matrix Dimensions

Every harness E2E result should identify these dimensions:

| Dimension | Values |
| --- | --- |
| OS | `windows`, `macos`, `linux` |
| Window system | Win32/UIA, AppKit/AX, X11/AT-SPI, Wayland/AT-SPI, WebView/CDP |
| Harness | Electron, Tauri, WPF, WinUI3, WebView2, AppKit, SwiftUI, WKWebView, GTK3 |
| Action targeting | `ax`, `px`, `page`, `not_applicable` |
| Delivery | `background`, `foreground`, `N/A` |
| Scope | `window`, `desktop`, `N/A` |
| Oracle | App state, accessibility state, focus state, pixel state, protocol state |
| Test status | `pass`, `fail`, `skip`, `environment_error` |
| Observed behavior | `delivered`, `refused`, `no_effect`, `error`, `not_run` |

Focus preservation is a cross-cutting oracle, not a separate matrix family.
When a background action is tested, the row should attach the platform focus
observer in addition to checking the target application's external state.

`AX` and `PX` describe how an action addresses a target. They are not capture
modes. `get_window_state` returns the tree and screenshot together; the action
uses an element index or coordinates.

## Unit And Deterministic Tests

These run without the repo-local GUI applications:

| Area | Location | Coverage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core driver logic | `rust/crates/*/src/**` | Protocol values, sessions, schemas, image helpers, input helpers, configuration, telemetry, CLI behavior |
| MCP and CLI boundary | `rust/crates/cua-driver/tests/protocol_*` | Handshake, tool registration, tool calls, media, sessions, and errors |
| Lifecycle sessions and target migration | Core `session`, `session_tools`, `action_target`, and compatibility `capture_scope` tests plus `session_capture_scope_test.rs` | One implicit session per transport, five-minute idle policy, in-flight and exact-once cleanup, owner-scoped inspection and revival, per-call target validation, and legacy capture-scope compatibility |
| Tool-contract gate | `schema_consistency_test.rs` | Shared tool schema parity and reviewed risk metadata across OS backends |
| Configuration transport | `transport_config_persistence_test.rs` | CLI and MCP configuration persistence |
| Token and protocol surfaces | `protocol_element_token_test.rs`, related tests | JSON-RPC-visible contract behavior |
| Permission modes and policy startup | `permission_policy_startup_test.rs`, `daemon_required_test.rs`, core `authorization`, `policy`, and `session_manifest` tests | Fail-before-bind policy loading, managed/user intersection, immutable standard/autonomous/unrestricted startup, danger acknowledgement, admin disable, deny-by-default manifests, and canonical daemon dispatch |
| Protected browser grants | Core `consent`, `browser::grant`, `browser::engine`, and `browser::v2_tests` | Exact request digests, provider authentication seam and deadline, persistent-indicator activation, Stop/session teardown, forged legacy artifact refusal, exact PID/window manifest scope, and the live-origin decision path used before mutation |

Some protocol tests spawn the driver process. They remain deterministic because
they do not launch a real target application or require a desktop. They should
be reported with the unit gate, separately from Harness E2E.

The ordinary unit gate must not run `#[ignore]` GUI tests and must not turn
missing desktop fixtures into silent skips.

## Harness E2E: Shared Web Applications

Electron and Tauri are separate repo-local applications that load the shared
web harness. The fixture exposes action-specific controls and external state
markers rather than an application task that duplicates those same actions.

Source:

- `tests/fixtures/shared/web/index.html`
- `tests/fixtures/apps/cross-platform/electron/`
- `tests/fixtures/apps/cross-platform/tauri/`
- `rust/crates/cua-driver/tests/cross_platform_behavior_test.rs`

The shared harness exposes deterministic external markers for these actions:

| Action family | Actions | Addressing | Delivery |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pointer | Left click, right click, double click | AX and PX | Background and foreground |
| Keyboard and text | Type text, Return, hotkey, type then Return | AX and PX where supported | Background and foreground |
| Scroll | Scroll | AX and PX where supported | Background and foreground |
| Child windows | Open child window | AX and PX | Background and foreground |
| Drag | Drag source to drop target | PX | Background and foreground |
| State controls | Checkbox, radio, combo, slider | AX or PX by control | Mode declared per action |
| Editor | Type, save, saved-state readback | AX and PX where supported | Mode declared per action |

The Rust shared catalog declares 40 evidence-bearing cells per harness
application. Windows and Linux run 80 shared cells across Electron and Tauri;
macOS also runs the native WKWebView host for 120 shared cells. Each host covers
the full AX/PX and foreground/background cross-product for click, text,
keyboard, sequential type-then-Return, scroll, and child-window actions, plus
both delivery modes for PX drag and AX editor-save. A
background capability refusal is a valid result only when the test verifies the
declared structured refusal and the no-focus/no-z-order/no-input-leak side
effect. Background posture requires one foreground window to contain the target
geometry, not merely overlap it. The lane preflight also injects deliberate
focus and input violations and requires the sentinel to detect both before its
results are trusted. A refusal fails a cell whose contract requires delivery.
Canonical reporting rejects skips and enforces the complete shared catalog
size for unfiltered runs. Diagnostic filters are allowed, but matching zero
cells is always an error.

## Harness E2E: Native Windows

Windows native harnesses are repo-local applications built from source:

| Harness | Source test | Coverage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WPF | `harness_wpf_test.rs` | UIA controls, text, keys, pointer actions, scroll, drag, popups, menus, modal windows |
| WinUI3 | `harness_winui3_test.rs` | XAML controls, text, checkbox/radio, slider, combo, popup |
| WebView2 | `harness_web_test.rs` | Window discovery, CDP page access, JavaScript, DOM click path |
| Desktop target | `desktop_scope_windows_test.rs` | Per-call window/desktop modality, full-display capture, screen-absolute click/scroll, and strict rejection |
| Desktop invariants | Testkit `DesktopObserver` plus typed launch/capture/cursor owners | Cross-cutting focus, z-order, minimized-launch, screenshot, cursor, and desktop checks |

Native controls use AX/UIA state as their oracle. Pointer actions also use PX
where the tool contract requires coordinates. Current `set_value` rows declare
background delivery and attach desktop-side-effect oracles.

## Harness E2E: macOS

| Harness | Source test | Coverage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AppKit | `harness_appkit_test.rs` | AX tree/capture, AX value/text, AX scroll, PX clicks, and foreground slider drag across the proven delivery modes; background drag is an exact refusal |
| SwiftUI | `harness_swiftui_test.rs` | AX tree/capture, background click/value, and foreground popover-trigger state |
| WKWebView | `cross_platform_behavior_test.rs` | Dedicated native host running the full 40-cell shared web catalog |
| Desktop target | `desktop_scope_macos_test.rs` | Per-call window/desktop modality, screen-absolute action delivery, and strict rejection |
| Installed-app launch/focus | `installed_app_launch_macos_test.rs` | Real Calculator/TextEdit launch and focus behavior in the canonical logged-in lane |
| Installed-app text | `installed_app_textedit_macos_test.rs` | Real TextEdit AX background write and verification in the canonical logged-in lane |

The AppKit `snapshot_publication` regression holds a fixture PNG write with FIFO
backpressure while replacing a button at the same AX index. It exercises the
built-in `get_window_state` and `click` tools and uses an independent fixture
activation journal to reject wrong-target activation and verify fresh-token
recovery. The macOS runner includes this regression.

macOS uses the installed ScreenCaptureKit/AX permissions for GUI runs. Its
maintainer acceptance gate runs in a disposable clone of the stopped Lume
SIP-off golden image described in the [macOS Lume runner
guide](../tests/runners/macos-lume/README.md). Maintainers build that private
seed from the sanitized public base `macos-tahoe-cua:26.5.2`. The repo-local
harnesses are canonical; Calculator and TextEdit are supporting real-app
checks. SwiftUI's popover trigger is proven independently from the remaining
transient-panel AX discovery gap.

## Harness E2E: Linux

| Harness | Source test | Window system | Coverage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Electron | `cross_platform_behavior_test.rs` | X11 and hosted Sway | Shared web action matrix |
| Tauri | `cross_platform_behavior_test.rs` | X11 and hosted Sway | Shared web action matrix |
| GTK3 | `harness_gtk3_test.rs` | X11/AT-SPI and Wayland/AT-SPI where configured | Native GTK controls and input |
| Desktop target | `desktop_scope_linux_test.rs` | X11/Wayland | Per-call window/desktop modality, screen-absolute action delivery, and strict rejection |

Nix provides the Linux build and desktop environment. X11 and Wayland are
separate matrix dimensions because their capture and input contracts differ.
Linux runs do not produce GIF output. Every canonical GUI cell retains an MP4
and trajectory alongside screenshots, AX trees, structured results, and driver
logs for E2E evidence.

## Action Delivery Matrix

The current per-OS delivery/refusal ledger is maintained in
[`action-support.md`](action-support.md). This section defines the coverage
policy; the ledger records empirical status.

For each OS and harness where the action is supported, the canonical E2E suite
should cover both delivery modes:

| Action | Background | Foreground | Addressing |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Left click | Required delivery or a declared refusal contract | Required | AX, PX |
| Right click | Required delivery or a declared refusal contract | Required | AX, PX |
| Double click | Required delivery or a declared refusal contract | Required | AX, PX |
| Drag | Required delivery or a declared refusal contract | Required | PX, with AX discovery |
| Scroll | Required delivery or a declared refusal contract | Required | AX, PX where supported |
| Type text | Required delivery or a declared refusal contract | Required | AX, PX where supported |
| Press key | Required delivery or a declared refusal contract | Required | AX, PX where supported |
| Hotkey | Required delivery or a declared refusal contract | Required | AX, PX where supported |
| Set value | Required in current native rows | Not separately declared | AX/UIA/AXValue |
| Screenshot | N/A | N/A | Window or desktop capture |
| Page/CDP | N/A | N/A | Page selector/JavaScript |

`N/A` means the API has no delivery mode for that operation. A refusal is a
passing observation only when the Rust case expects refusal, the exact code is
allowed, and the desktop-side-effect oracles pass.

## CI And Local Entry Points

| Gate | Environment | Entry point |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linux unit/source | Nix Linux CI | `nix build .#checks.x86_64-linux.cua-driver-build .#checks.x86_64-linux.cua-driver-linux-rust-unit` |
| Windows unit/compile | `windows-latest` | Package-scoped `cargo test --all-targets --no-run --locked` |
| Windows Harness E2E | Active Windows user session | `scripts/ci/windows/run-rust-e2e.ps1 -RequireGui` |
| Linux X11 Harness E2E | Nix X11 session | `scripts/ci/linux/run-rust-e2e.sh` |
| Linux Sway Harness E2E | Controlled wlroots session | `scripts/ci/linux/run-rust-e2e-wayland.sh` |
| Linux nested-compositor E2E | Controlled experimental session | `scripts/ci/linux/run-rust-e2e-inject.sh` |
| Linux representative desktop E2E | Existing GNOME, KDE, or Xorg login | `scripts/ci/linux/run-rust-e2e-desktop.sh <desktop>` |
| macOS Harness E2E | Maintainer Lume SIP-off worker with a logged-in session and inherited grants, or a disposable worker prepared with the checked-in macOS consent seed helper | `libs/cua-driver/tests/runners/macos-lume/run-all.sh` |

Workflows select private execution lanes. Rust source owns scenario definitions,
fixture oracles, and result records. OS runners only build the driver, stage the
local harnesses, establish the desktop session, collect evidence, and publish
the shared report.

## Evidence And Ownership

Every Harness E2E cell should produce:

```text
recordings/<cell-label>-pid<pid>-<sequence>/recording.mp4
recordings/<cell-label>-pid<pid>-<sequence>/trajectory.json
results.jsonl
<rust-target>.log
```

The GitHub summary links the exact recording path from the corresponding row to
its lane archive. Target logs remain lane-level diagnostics. Unit tests need
logs and test-result output, but do not need desktop video.

When a new action or modality is added, update this document, the shared fixture
oracle, the Rust test, and the OS-specific runner selection together. This is
the cross-OS checklist that prevents a Windows-only test from being mistaken
for cross-platform coverage.
