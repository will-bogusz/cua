# Experimental cua-driver SDK contract

This directory contains the checked-in, generated portable cua-driver SDK
contract. The Rust crate at
`rust/crates/cua-driver-contract` is the source of truth. It generates this
manifest and exports the request/result records consumed by the live daemon and
the UniFFI SDK. Python and TypeScript bindings are generated from the compiled
Rust library by `scripts/generate-uniffi-bindings.mjs`.

Execution, platform integration, policy, and permission handling remain in
Rust. `CuaDriver.create()` owns that runtime in the importing process;
`connect()` uses an existing daemon through the shared Rust socket client.
Agents independently use the public `cua-driver mcp`
surface through their runtime's existing MCP client.

## Scope and compatibility

The typed slice covers the cross-platform session lifecycle tools:

- `start_session`
- `get_session`
- `list_sessions`
- `end_session`

Ordinary calls do not need `start_session`. The runtime creates one implicit
session for the authenticated transport lease and reuses it until transport
close, explicit end, or five minutes of inactivity. `escalate_session` and
`get_session_state` remain deprecated compatibility tools for legacy
capture-scope sessions. There is no `deescalate_session` tool.

It also covers the portable whole-desktop loop:

- `get_desktop_state`
- `get_screen_size`
- `get_cursor_position`
- `move_cursor` with an exact per-call window or desktop `target`
- `set_window_frame` for exact, read-back-verified top-level window geometry
- `invoke_menu` for an exact native application-menu path resolved live at each hop
- `click` with an exact per-call window or desktop `target`
- `drag` and `scroll` in native desktop coordinates
- `type_text`, `press_key`, and `hotkey` against the foreground application
- `clipboard_read` for available types and opt-in plain-text readback
- `clipboard_write` for text, image, and file-URL clipboard content

The typed native-window flow includes `list_apps`, `list_windows`, and
`get_window_state`, with discovery records, snapshot-bound element tokens,
optional accessibility metadata, and screenshot images attached to the typed
snapshot. `click` accepts one `ClickPosition` (coordinates or element token), an
explicit `ActionTarget`, and an explicit `InputDeliveryMode`, and returns
`ActionResult` directly. Native refusals become `DriverError.Tool`.
See the [0.8 SDK contract migration](../docs/native-window-sdk-migration.md)
for the intentional SDK break and unchanged CLI/MCP wire forms.

The canonical session-owned cursor slice is shared exactly by MCP and both
generated SDKs:

- `set_agent_cursor_enabled`
- `set_agent_cursor_motion`
- `set_agent_cursor_theme`
- `get_agent_cursor_state`

Cursor artwork is selected by installed theme ID. Theme installation and
dotLottie compilation are intentionally local CLI operations, not SDK or MCP
tool calls.

The checked-observation slice is also shared by MCP and both generated SDKs:

- `verify_state` evaluates one to eight ANDed predicates against one exact
  `(pid, window_id)`.
- Window existence/bounds and semantic accessibility element
  existence/value/enabled/selected predicates return `satisfied`,
  `unsatisfied`, or `unknown`.
- A bounded poll can require consecutive stable samples. `unknown` never
  implies success.
- `include_screenshot=true` adds final image content for a multimodal agent
  harness to interpret. Cua Driver does not OCR or assign task meaning to it.

Session contracts are marked `canonical_runtime`: the same typed Rust input,
output, and metadata declaration builds the live MCP tool. The preferred action
target is a tagged union: `{kind:"window", pid, window_id}` or
`{kind:"desktop", display_id:"primary"}`. Legacy flat `scope`, `pid`, and
`window_id` fields remain accepted during the compatibility window but cannot
be mixed with `target`. Desktop contracts
are marked `portable_subset`: their typed Rust inputs are a deliberately
narrower projection of the richer macOS, Linux, and Windows runtime schemas.
Platform handlers retain their existing wire parsers, including the legacy
desktop-coordinate click projection. The SDK serializes its stricter click
addressing to those same native fields. Successful
SDK-path structured payloads are validated against the shared Rust output
types in the live registry.

The platform schemas remain richer by design; they are not an independent SDK
manifest. A cross-platform CI matrix proves every portable schema is accepted
by each live registry, and the published tools resolve their capability tokens
from the contract rather than a second runtime map.

Both SDKs retain a generic tool call so runtime-discovered and
platform-specific tools remain usable. The generated manifest records tool
platforms, capabilities, annotations, input schemas, and experimental success
schemas. The live MCP `tools/list` response advertises these successful-result
schemas as `outputSchema`; all action tools share the closed `ActionResult`
schema even when their richer runtime input is not part of the portable SDK
manifest.

See [Action results and postcondition verification](../docs/action-result-contract.md)
for the wire shape and 0.14 migration guidance.

`escalation.target` is the driver's whole vocabulary for "where to go next":
`pixel`, `foreground`, `page`, `session`, `element` (re-address the exact
control), and `snapshot` (re-observe first). A driver never names a
consumer's own tool in prose — it emits one of these and the consumer
renders the route it actually exposes, because only the consumer knows
which routes it has.

Compatibility is tracked separately at each boundary:

| Field | Current | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `contract_version` | `0.9.0` | Generated manifest and typed SDK shape |
| `tools_list_schema_version` | `1` | cua-driver `tools/list` extension shape |
| `capability_version` | `1` | Additive capability-token vocabulary |
| `mcp_protocol_version` | `2025-06-18` | Legacy `initialize.params.protocolVersion` and loopback HTTP compatibility version; modern stdio negotiation is endpoint-owned |

This implementation does not use WASM. UniFFI distributes the shared Rust
implementation to Python and Node. Permission identity follows the selected
runtime host. The language packages do not
generate or maintain separate MCP transports.

## Vocabulary the manifest does not describe

Only the twenty action tools share a generated schema. Everything below is
contract vocabulary that travels as MCP structured content, so no generated
type or manifest entry describes it and a consumer must parse it
defensively. It is recorded here because two implementations have to agree
on the spelling.

`bring_to_front` is not an action-result tool. When the exact window is the
process's focused window but one of the process's own panels is in front of
it, the call succeeds with `code:
"bring_to_front_exact_window_verified_behind_owned_panel"`,
`activated: true`, `exact_window_effect.front_in_process: false` retained,
and a top-level `obscured_by` naming the panel:

```json
{
  "obscured_by": {
    "window_id": 17013,
    "title": "",
    "layer": 183,
    "ax_backed": true,
    "role": "AXWindow",
    "subrole": "AXSystemDialog"
  }
}
```

`window_id` and `layer` are numbers, and any member the driver could not
resolve is omitted rather than guessed. The same key and the same shape
carry the obscuring window in the `element_disabled` refusal payload, so a
consumer parses one shape in both places.

Platform producers also emit `escalation.recommended` rung tokens that are
not escalation targets: `chunk`, `verify_state`, `select_then_commit`. The
legacy normalizer drops those rather than guess at a target. `px` is the
one alias it does accept, for `pixel`.

## Generate and verify

From `libs/cua-driver/rust`:

```bash
cargo run -p cua-driver-contract --bin cua-contract-gen -- all
cargo run -p cua-driver-contract --bin cua-contract-gen -- all --check
cargo test -p cua-driver-contract
cargo test -p cua-driver-core --test contract_parity
cargo test -p cua-driver --test schema_consistency_test \
  portable_desktop_contracts_are_accepted_by_active_backend
```

SDK loader tests live in `python/tests/test_uniffi_loader.py` and
`typescript/test/native-loader.test.mjs`. CI checks the manifest generator,
deterministically regenerates both UniFFI binding sets, verifies parity against
the live tool registry, and crosses the real Python and Node FFI loaders into a
deterministic daemon-socket fixture.
