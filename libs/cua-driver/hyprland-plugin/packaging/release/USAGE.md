# Install the pinned Hyprland plugin

This source distribution builds the Cua production input candidate without a
monorepo checkout. Use the exact Driver component release named by
`release_tag` in `SOURCE-PROVENANCE.json`. The Arch package version follows that
Driver release; the plugin's CMake version is recorded as `plugin_version`.

The source generator does not perform native certification. Its
`native_certified: false` field describes that limitation. Consult the release's
separate native evidence for the exact source revision and environment before
using the candidate. A checksum proves agreement with the reviewed recipe, not
native compatibility by itself.

## Build and install

The supported build contract is Linux x86_64 with Hyprland `0.56.2-1`, headers
`0.56.2`, GCC `16.1.1 20260728`, and shared `libstdc++.so.6.0.36`. The compiler,
compositor, and module must resolve the same runtime bytes. A newer package or
compiler does not satisfy this contract. Arrange the pinned dependencies in the
target environment before building; the recipe does not install a toolchain or
alter runtime search paths.

Download the `cua-hyprland-plugin-DRIVER_VERSION-COMMIT_SHA.tar.gz` source archive
and matching `cua-hyprland-plugin-DRIVER_VERSION-COMMIT_SHA-build-kit.tar.gz` from
the same exact component release. The filenames contain the release version
and full source commit SHA. Verify both archives against that release's
published checksums before extracting the build kit into a dedicated empty
directory. Place the source archive alongside its extracted `PKGBUILD`,
`SOURCE-PROVENANCE.json`, `README.md`, `lifecycle.py`, and `SHA256SUMS`.

From that directory, review the recipe and verify its files and source archive:

```sh
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS
```

Run `makepkg` as an ordinary user in that directory. It uses `/usr/bin/g++` by
default. If your matching compiler is staged elsewhere, set `CUA_RELEASE_CXX`
to its absolute executable path before invoking `makepkg`. The verifier checks
its identity, an emitted compiler probe, the compositor, and the shared runtime.
The recipe builds and tests the plugin with production input enabled,
experimental signed input disabled, and tracing disabled.

Before installing or replacing a module, save your work and exit the Hyprland
desktop session. From a text console, install the single package produced by
the recipe:

```sh
package_file="$(makepkg --packagelist)"
sudo pacman -U "$package_file"
```

Installation writes the module to
`/usr/lib/cua/hyprland/cua-hyprland-plugin.so`, its license under
`/usr/share/licenses/cua-hyprland-plugin/`, and source/build provenance under
`/usr/share/cua-hyprland-plugin/`. It has no install hooks, automatic loading, or
configuration changes. Keep the package file and its provenance for rollback.

## Qualify package lifecycle in a disposable environment

Before installing in a desktop session, run the standalone lifecycle gate in a
disposable Linux x86_64 Arch environment with the pinned native dependencies,
`makepkg`, `bsdtar`, `pacman`, Python 3.11 or later, and `sudo` available. Use an
ordinary build user who can run `pacman` through `sudo -n` with existing
authorization; the gate fails if sudo needs an interactive password. It does not
install missing dependencies. It builds and tests using the recipe's native
compiler, compositor, and shared-runtime checks.

From a fresh, verified kit, replace `COMMIT_SHA` and `DRIVER_VERSION` with its
manifest values and `NEW_EVIDENCE_DIRECTORY` with a path that does not exist:

```sh
python3 lifecycle.py --kit . --revision COMMIT_SHA \
  --driver-version DRIVER_VERSION --output NEW_EVIDENCE_DIRECTORY
```

For a compiler staged outside `/usr/bin/g++`, add `--cxx` with its absolute path.
A development kit generated from an explicit committed SHA also works before
release publication; passing this gate does not claim that assets are published.

The gate copies the kit into its evidence directory and runs `makepkg`. It
checks the package's exact module, license, and provenance payload, rejects
configuration files and install hooks, and checks module hashes against the
build provenance. It uses `sudo pacman` only with new isolated filesystem and
database roots, explicit configuration, disabled scriptlets, and empty hook
directories. It installs, removes, and reinstalls the package, checking the
installed bytes and an isolated operator-configuration sentinel after each
transaction. A second root must refuse the package with a specific Hyprland
dependency error. A successful install with matching dependency metadata is
the positive control for that refusal.

These roots contain metadata-only Hyprland and GCC runtime dependency fixtures.
They test ALPM dependency resolution, not execution of those dependencies.
The runner does not load a plugin, edit host desktop configuration, install a
host package, or restart the compositor. It can run while a separate desktop
proof is in progress. A pass writes `RESULT.json`; build and transaction logs,
the package, and isolated roots remain for inspection in the evidence directory.
Review logs before sharing them, and retain or discard the disposable environment
through its normal lifecycle.

This gate does not prove live activation, restart, upgrade, or rollback. To
complete those gates, schedule the fresh-session procedures below after any
ongoing desktop proof finishes. Preserve the prior package and matching native
environment, verify activation and input after replacement and restart, then
repeat with the saved package and another fresh compositor. Published release
download and checksum verification also require separate evidence.

## Activate in a fresh desktop session

Start a fresh Hyprland session with the pinned compositor. Load the module
explicitly and inspect its status:

```sh
hyprctl plugin load /usr/lib/cua/hyprland/cua-hyprland-plugin.so
hyprctl -j cua:status
```

The local input transport is disabled by default. Enabling it grants trusted
local desktop input capability; Driver continues to enforce its own permission
policy on individual calls. In Omarchy's Lua configuration, add:

```lua
hl.config({plugin = {cua = {enabled = true}}})
```

For a legacy Hyprland configuration, add:

```text
plugin:cua:enabled = true
```

After editing the configuration, run `hyprctl reload`, then inspect
`hyprctl -j cua:status` again. A runtime keyword or Lua evaluation without a
configuration reload does not reconcile the input sockets. Check the status's
protocol, capabilities, socket paths, and compositor identity. A loaded module
alone does not prove input availability. Start the matching Driver with
`CUA_DRIVER_RS_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1`; its production input protocol is v3 by default.

The input path checks exact native application packages: `libreoffice-fresh
26.2.5-3` for Calc and `inkscape 1.4.4-6`. Each background input lane publishes
its own canonical `evdev/pc105/us` keymap, independent of user options such as
Caps Lock remapped to Ctrl or Super. Existing actions are canceled when the
physical keymap changes; start a fresh action after the reload. Foreground
keyboard delivery remains limited to the canonical physical map, while
foreground pointer-only actions are layout-independent. There are two
independent input lanes. A third concurrent owner receives a lane-busy refusal.
Other application versions, Chromium/Electron, and XWayland are outside this
input contract. Use normal Driver snapshots and background actions, then verify
the application result; a delivery acknowledgement is not
proof that the intended edit occurred. Do not automatically replay partial or
unknown actions. The release's native evidence identifies the qualified
operation cells within these limits.

## Upgrade, rollback, or remove

Keep a copy of the installed package and its exact compositor/compiler/runtime
provenance before upgrading. Build and test the replacement against its declared
pins. Exit the desktop session before replacing the package, install the
replacement from a text console, then start a fresh desktop session and repeat
activation and status checks. Do not hot-unload/reload the module to replace it:
production input retains resources until the compositor process exits.

If the replacement fails validation, exit the desktop session, reinstall the
saved package with `pacman -U` and its exact saved package filename, and restore
its matching compositor/runtime environment before starting a fresh session.
Do not force installation past the exact Hyprland dependency. If matching pins
are unavailable, leave the plugin inactive and use Driver without this plugin.

To disable input, remove the enabling setting or set it to false and run
`hyprctl reload`. To remove the package, remove any operator-added plugin load
or enable settings, exit the desktop session, and run
`sudo pacman -R cua-hyprland-plugin` from a text console. Start a fresh session
afterward. Unloading, upgrading, or removing a file in a running compositor does
not substitute for restarting that compositor.
