//! Pure exact-target decisions for macOS-style background input (v1).
//!
//! Background mutation must carry one exact `(pid, CGWindowID)` target from
//! request to postcondition. The platform shell gathers fresh facts about that
//! target immediately before dispatch and asks this module for exactly one
//! decision: execute the requested route, or refuse with a stable
//! machine-readable reason. The shell never improvises a second actuator after
//! a refusal, and a sibling window's state can never confirm the requested
//! action.
//!
//! This module owns no platform objects and performs no I/O, so the complete
//! state-policy matrix is testable in ordinary CI. See
//! `docs/macos-background-input-v1-plan.md` for the design contract.
