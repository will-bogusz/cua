        description: "Walk a running app's AX tree and return BOTH a structured \
            `elements` array (preferred) AND a Markdown rendering of the same tree \
            (back-compat). Every actionable element is tagged with [element_index N] \
            in the markdown and as `element_index` in the structured array; pass \
            each element's `element_token` to click, type_text, press_key, etc.\n\n\
            INVARIANT: call get_window_state once per turn per (pid, window_id) before any \
            element action. The next snapshot of the window replaces this one, stales its \
            element tokens, and lists the replaced ids in `invalidated_snapshot_ids`.\n\n\
            PREFERRED CONSUMERS read `structuredContent.elements` (one entry per \
            indexed row with `element_index`, `role`, `label`, `value` (the \
            element's text/AXValue when present — use it to verify what a field \
            holds), `actions` (names of the standard AX actions the element \
            exposes, omitted when empty), `custom_actions` (the application's \
            own secondary actions, each `{name, raw}`: `name` is the label a \
            person reads, `raw` is the string to pass back as `click`'s \
            `action` to perform it), `frame: {x,y,w,h}`, `parent_index`, \
            `depth`). The markdown \
            `tree_markdown` stays available \
            and unchanged in shape for existing text-parsing callers — but new \
            fields will only be added to the structured side.\n\n\
            Always returns BOTH the element tree AND a screenshot — ground on \
            both and cross-check (the tree lies on some surfaces: Electron \
            echo-confirms, Catalyst null values, virtualized off-viewport rows \
            with `h:1` frames). You choose the modality at ACTION time, not here: \
            an element ax action (pass `element_token` → the \
            accessibility rung) or an element px action (pass `x`,`y` → the pixel \
            rung, read straight off this screenshot). `capture_mode` is deprecated \
            and ignored. Pass `include_screenshot:false` to skip the grab and get \
            the tree only — the cheap path when you're just re-indexing before an \
            element ax action.\n\n\
            The mirror image: pass `include_accessibility_tree:false` to SKIP the \
            AX walk entirely (the expensive part, bounded by timeout_ms) and return just the \
            screenshot plus window metadata — `window_bounds`, `screenshot_scale`, \
            `screenshot_width`/`screenshot_height`, `app_name`, and `window_title` \
            — the capture-only path for rendering a live window preview / \
            picture-in-picture without paying for perception. Setting BOTH \
            `include_accessibility_tree:false` and `include_screenshot:false` is an \
            error (nothing to return). Optional `max_image_dimension` overrides the \
            configured screenshot long-edge limit for this call; use 0 for native \
            resolution. The legacy `max_dimension` remains a tighter cap for \
            compatibility.\n\n\
            The snapshot is SCOPED to `window_id`: a window_id that no longer exists is \
            refused with `window_id_not_found`, and one owned by another process is \
            refused with `window_owner_pid_mismatch` naming the real `owner_pid` to retry \
            with (macOS hosts a sandboxed app's Open/Save panel out-of-process, so its \
            window belongs to the panel service, not the app). If the window is live under \
            this pid but its accessibility surface can't be resolved, the tree comes back \
            EMPTY with `degraded_reason: ax_window_unresolved` and the screenshot of the \
            requested window; background input is refused until it resolves, so \
            re-snapshot or act with `delivery_mode:\"foreground\"`. When that pid is an \
            app still launching (its window exists before it answers accessibility), the \
            walk first waits up to `timeout_ms` for it; if it never answers, the tree comes \
            back EMPTY with `degraded_reason: ax_app_launching`, `truncated: true` and \
            `truncation_reason: app_lookup_timeout`. A window on another \
            Space still resolves by its exact CGWindowID. This tool never returns another \
            surface's elements under your window_id. Before exposing a screenshot, \
            its raw dimensions are validated as a coherent 1x/2x representation of \
            the requested WindowServer bounds. `px_frame_mismatch` or \
            `px_capture_unavailable` omits an unprovable screenshot/pixel frame \
            instead of guessing a transform; the truthful AX payload remains available.\n\n\
            Optional `query` projects both tree_markdown and structured `elements` to \
            matching lines plus their ancestor chain (case-insensitive substring). The \
            element_index values are unchanged, the complete snapshot remains actionable, \
            and `element_count` continues to report its total size; \
            `filtered_element_count` reports the projected response size.\n\n\
            Optional `max_elements` / `max_depth` bound the AX walk to mitigate \
            context-window blow-up on Electron / Obsidian / large web apps that \
            produce 10k+ element trees. When applied, BOTH the markdown \
            and the structured elements are truncated identically. Omit both for \
            current default behaviour (≤2 000 elements, depth ≤25).".into(),
