//! Process-lifetime Chromium/Electron accessibility enablement.
//!
//! Chromium-family apps (Arc, VS Code, Electron shells) ship their web-content
//! AX tree OFF and only build it once an assistive client asks for it. The
//! walker flips `AXManualAccessibility` (falling back to
//! `AXEnhancedUserInterface` only when the modern attribute is unsupported —
//! see [`super::bindings::enable_chromium_accessibility`]) and then waits for
//! the asynchronously-built tree to actually appear before it is read.
//!
//! The wait is a poll for the expected tree shape, not a fixed sleep: measured
//! on cold VS Code / Cursor / Obsidian launches, the Chromium tree takes
//! 0.6-2.4 s to materialize, so a fixed half-second settle walks a still-empty
//! app and reports a four-row title-bar window as if that were the whole UI.
//! A second assertion after materialization is what attaches the editor buffer
//! (`AXTextArea` with the document) in the VS Code family.
//!
//! The "already enabled" cache is keyed by the observed process lifetime
//! (pid + kernel start time), not by the numeric pid alone: pids are recycled,
//! and a relaunched Electron app must not inherit a stale "enabled" decision
//! that would skip enablement and return an empty web-content tree. It is
//! populated only when materialization was observed, so a timed-out app is
//! retried by the next walk instead of being treated as enabled forever.
