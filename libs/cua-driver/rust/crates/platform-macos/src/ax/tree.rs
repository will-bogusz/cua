//! AX tree walker: produces the treeMarkdown string and element cache.
//!
//! Format (matching libs/cua-driver exactly):
//!   `INDENT- [N] AXRole "Title" [value="..." actions=[...]]`
//!   `INDENT- AXStaticText = "value"`  (non-indexed)
//!
//! Rules (from cua-driver reference):
//! - An element is addressable (gets an index) when it has ≥1 action name or
//!   exposes a writable AXValue control surface. Enablement does not gate it;
//!   a disabled control is published with `enabled: false`.
//! - A subrole is rendered only when it does not restate the role's own stem
//!   (`AXRow` + `AXTableRow`); the element payload always carries the raw value.
//! - Non-actionable leaf nodes with a value are rendered as `AXRole = "value"`.
//! - AXStaticText with no title/value is omitted.
//! - Tree is walked depth-first; element_index is assigned in DFS order.
